"BE HERE NOW.
I find myself, In Time.
Yesterday consists of moments;
Now passed through
the realm of my experience
And which exist forever Now
Beyond my sphere of influence.
The future is decided Now,
Beginning chain reaction…
Tomorrow is this moment
Now, awaiting transformation…
All that ever is is Now,
This present circumstance…
Fleeting Yet eternal Now
Pregnant With Potential Now
The Culmination Of Every Moment Passed…
Now upon Now in a spiral dance,
Is all that I have ever been,
And all that I have yet to be,
All present Now, this moment…
Within Me.
Right Now."
